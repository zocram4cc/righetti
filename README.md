# Righetti
## Righetti - Gameplay patch for PES21

Righetti is the unofficial proposed gameplay patch, via dt18 constant modding, specifically developed for and by [the 4chan Cup](https://implyingrigged.info) for its future use in Pro Evolution Soccer 2021, to attempt to fix its lack of entertainment value when watched in coach mode. Its name is a very unsubtle nod at the nationality of the original developer.

**Note:** You can contribute to the patch's development, but please, upload any changes\forks in BIN, CPK and text form *at the same time*. Don't make the documentation drift from the actual binary. Thank you.

**Current patch notes:**
- Significantly reduced all wait times, making the game feel a lot snappier.
- Expanded all ranges for passing options across the board, giving the AI more options.
- Boosted the AI's defence and attack levels, making them press more. (see team/basePosition)
- Made the AI more capable of seeing potential throughball targets, boosting counters (see team/spaceRun)
- Buffed the Box to Box playstyle by making it stick to opposing players for longer.
- Slightly nerfed the defence's marking abilities.
- Very slightly nerfed the keepers.
- About a million more minor changes across the board.

**Known bugs:**
- Excessive tendency for the AI to pass laterally and swap wings.
- Shot count is still lower than desired.
- The animation for centering the ball tends to play twice.
- Ball physics are not exactly perfect yet.

### How do I read this shit
The text files follow this format:
```bash
STOCK VALUE   PATCHED VALUE //variable description
```

##TODO:
- Test, test, and test some more. (You) too can help in finding weird corner cases.
- Reformat the docs since I am a retard and can't into legibility.
