## Righetti - Gameplay patch for PES21

Righetti is the gameplay patch specifically developed for and by [the 4chan Cup](https://implyingrigged.info) for its use in Pro Evolution Soccer 2021, to attempt to fix its lack of entertainment value when watched in coach mode, by editing a legacy file Konami includes in all of its games in data pack 18 which allows the user to tweak a number of gameplay constants loaded at match time. Its name is a very unsubtle nod at the nationality of the original developer.

**Note:** You can contribute to the patch's development, but please, upload any changes\forks in BIN, CPK and text form *at the same time*. Don't make the documentation drift from the actual binary. Thank you.
